# LunaCompile

A small script compiler to .luna format that LunaLoad (Brawl Stars mod loader) can read and parse!

# Why?

1. Downloading one file is better than downloading multiple files.
2. It's easier to distribute a single file.
3. It's easier to manage and update.
4. It's easier to read and make quick updates.

# How to use?

Even though LunaLoad isn't out yet, you can still use this to compile your scripts but I don't know where you will use them lol

```
Usage: LunaCompile <ModDirectory>
```

A ModDirectory is the directory that contains your mod files. It has `header.json` and `index.js` files.

At the moment the compiler is barebones and just for testing purposes.

# TODO

- Add Image Support
- Add Manifest with assets baked into one .luna file
